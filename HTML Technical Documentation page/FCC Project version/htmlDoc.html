        <header>What is HTML?</header>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        
        
        <textarea rows="13"disabled="true" style="border: none;  width: 100%; " >

        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="">
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
          <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
          <li><strong>The content: </strong>his is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
          <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name, and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
        <h1>Nesting elements</h1>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="">
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content. In this case, the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.</p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>HTML comments</h1>
        <p>In HTML, as with most programming languages, there is a mechanism available to write comments in the code — comments are ignored by the browser and invisible to the user, and their purpose is to allow you to include comments in the code to say how your code works, what the different parts of the code do, etc. This can be very useful if you return to a code base that you've not worked on for six months, and can't remember what you did — or if you hand your code over to someone else to work on.</p>
        <p>To turn a section of content inside your HTML file into a comment, you need to wrap it in the special markers <!-- and -->, for example:</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>HTML text fundamentals</h1>
        <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly</p>
